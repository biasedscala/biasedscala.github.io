  <h1>BiasedScala: Why I Chose Scala</h1>
  <time datetime=2021-10-11T08:47:11&#43;0100 class="post-date">Mon, Oct 11, 2021</time>
  <p>I have been writing Scala code for many years, since sbt 0.11.x days.</p>
<p>I checked <a href="https://github.com/fujohnwang/hs2client">a project</a> that I open sourced many years ago when I was working at Alibaba, it tells me that it was 11 years ago.</p>
<p>What time flies&hellip;</p>
<p>In fact, I had tried many programming languages, so choosing Scala as the main programming language brings a lot thoughts and practices.</p>
<h1 id="pragmatic">Pragmatic</h1>
<p>I set up a big picture for a team that I think I would like to build and work in many years ago:</p>
<p><img src="/images/dream-team.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>One of the factor is <strong>Pragmatic</strong>, people who can get things done quickly and efficiently in a simple way always rock me.</p>
<p>When I chose Scala, <strong>Pragmatic</strong> is also an important factor. In those days, static program language with type omit and derivation helps a lot(we are lazy, right?). Semi-colons are annoying too. They are tiny things, but make me feel good, and don&rsquo;t want turn back to Java.</p>
<p>Another beautiful thing is, I can feel scala is designed with consistent philosophy inside. <strong>Complexity at first sight, but Simpliciy inside</strong>.</p>
<p>So I settled.</p>
<h1 id="personal-taste">Personal Taste</h1>
<p>If miscellaneous programming languages are different dish, Scala tastes so good for me.</p>
<p>Althought I find it has only a small community, but I still love to stick with it, at least it is good enough for me.</p>
<p>When I write scala codes, usually I am buidling some products to meet some customers' need, so scala as a programming lang is just a tool not my end, as long as it helps me get things done quickly and efficiently, I will keep sticking with it.</p>
<p>So I settled.</p>
<h1 id="adapt-for-flexibility">Adapt for flexibility</h1>
<p>Scala is not perfect, So I adapted it a lot.</p>
<p>Scala has a great community and wonderful ecosystem, but I don&rsquo;t connect and involve too much.</p>
<p>I use Scala as a better Java, that&rsquo;s my main principle, I called Scaja.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t use ZIO, shapeless, blablabla&hellip; event SBT (I had tried maven, gradle, sbt many times, but settle on maven.)</p>
<p>Nothing blocks me to get jobs done, I only chose <strong>Simple and Easy to Understand</strong> tools. As long as remembering that it&rsquo;s NOT the end but tools and means.</p>
<p>I have adapted scala a lot when using it in real scenarios, I am happy with it.</p>
<p>So I settled.</p>
